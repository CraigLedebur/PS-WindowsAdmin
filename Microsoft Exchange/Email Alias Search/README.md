Microsoft Exchange Email Alias Search
Created by Craig Ledebur
First commit on 16 January 2017

SUMMARY
---------------
A simple yet handy script that allows you to search for email addresses and aliases (even does wildcards, too!) and spits out the identity of the mailbox(es), group(s) or contact(s) matching them. It's very handy if you're trying to find out which Exchange object has the alias, and you're trying to remove or move it to another object.

Simply run Email Aliases.ps1 and follow the onscreen prompts. Must be in an Exchange Management Shell session.
